Shoelace
--------
It pulls your boots together.

Shoelace launces tiny VMs for testing or isolation. It builds a tiny, minimal
[initrd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_ramdisk) based on your
configuration, and boots your desired kernel. Typically, this kernel will be
the same kernel running the host.
